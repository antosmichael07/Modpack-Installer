# Modpack-Installer

After you downloaded it and opened it you can type `advanced` at the first question "Do you want to install the mods?" for a custom directory, but it's not recommended for someone who doesn't know how mods work. 
The custom directory has to be a full path `C:\example`, it cannot be this `C:\example\` neither this `.\example` <br>
You can download the mods and everything needed manually from my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/er75cqo3z44928hlbuem7/h?rlkey=l7sboyxwsr9x7jn3o09einybi&dl=0">dropbox</a>. <br>
