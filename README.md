# Modpack-Installer

If you'd like to, you can type "advanced" at the start for a custom directory, but it's not recommended for someone who doesn't know how mods work. <br>
The custom directory has to be something like this "C:\example", it cannot be this "C:\example\\" neither this ".\example" <br>

## How to download and install

Click on the main.exe <br> <br>
<img src="img1.png"/> <br> <br>

Then click on the three dots and download <br> <br>
<img src="img2.png"/> <br> <br>

After it's downloaded, open it and install.
